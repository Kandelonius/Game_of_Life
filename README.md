# Game_of_Life
Jet Brains and Lambda School project
Generates a universe based on a set of rules
Evolution is controlled by two rules:

An alive cell survives if has two or three alive neighbors; otherwise, it dies of boredom (<2) or overpopulation (>3)

A dead cell is reborn if it has exactly three alive neighbors

The program should apply these rules to each cell in order to compute the next generation.
